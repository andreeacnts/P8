# Lip Tracking for Multi-Modal Speech Capture System
This program tracks the movement of the lips and display a green curve around the lips.
The input can be either a video file where each frame is selectable through a slider and processed to extract lips boundaries, or a live webcam feed where the tracking is performed in real-time.

The algorithm to extract lips is based on a simple logarthmic equation to attenuate non-red pixels.
