Title: AUTOMATIC LIP DETECTION
Context: IPCV miniproject
Contributors: Andreea Ciontos & Laura M. Fenoy

Purpose: This solution is meant to automatically detect lips in a video stream.

Guidelines:

We have 3 separate folders:
    1. FaceSmileDetection 
        - a python script that uses opencv source packages for both face and mouth detection
        - a video file (.mp4) that can be used in the script
    2. MouthDetectionOnVideo
        - a python script that only detects the mouth (without face)
        - two video files (.mp4) that can be used in the script
    3. RedTracking
        - a python script that detects red objects
        - a video file (.mp4) that can be used for the script

To run this project the following were used:
    1. Windows 10
    2. Python 3.7.3
    3. OpenCV 4.0.0
